# MITRE-ATTACK
MITRE ATT$CK Framework Simulation by Forage DATACOM

<h2>üìÉDescripton:</h2> 

One of our leading tech corporation clients has fallen prey to a sophisticated cyberattack by a notorious Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) group known as APT34. The attack, believed to be sponsored by a foreign government, has left the organisation's network compromised, and valuable customer data and intellectual property has been stolen.

The idea is to answer the following questions related to the MITRE ATT&CK Framework:

‚óè **1 - What is their history?**

Its a group that has historically been linked with Iran‚Äôs Ministry of Intelligence and Security ( MOIS ) which started approximately in 2014, with spear phishing and nonpublic tools, probably attacks religiously or for government purposes. 

‚óè **2- Which nation/state are they associated with?**

According to sources, it is believed to be associated with Iran

‚óè **3- Do they target specific industries?**

Target specific organizations that appear to be carefully chosen, among them, the following countries stand out: Jordan, Lebanon and Pakistan.

‚óè **4- What are their motives?**

Are interested in everything going in the Middle East they are aiming to be on top, even i it means attacking allies. Their motives are probably just espionage and not destruction.

‚óè **5- What are the TTPs they use to conduct their attacks?**

***Tactics:*** Initial Access, Credential Access, Collection, Exfiltration, Command and Control.

***Techniques:*** Phishing, Spearphishing Attachment, DNS tunneling, SSH.

***Procedures:*** The attacker sends a spearphishing email with a malicious document, but we have no information about the destructive power of these files and presupposes that it is only for espionage. The attack results in the installation of a .NET backdoor, one is called Veaty and the other Spearal, both malware binaries allow command and control(C2).

‚óè **6- What security measures could the client implement to defend against cyberattacks conducted by this APT?**

Uses a specific tool that filters emails, leaving only authorized emails. To avoid cases where email spoofing is used, the correct thing to do would be to train employees to identify malicious emails, even if they seem real. Always ask a superior if you have any doubts. Also, confirm with the person who sent the email by phone if possible.
